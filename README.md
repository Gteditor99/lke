## Installation

To install `lke`, download the latest release from the [releases page](github.com/gteditor99/lke/releases) and extract the archive to a folder of your choice.

## Building from source

`lke` is written in Go, so you'll need to have Go installed on your system to build it. You can download Go from [here](https://go.dev/dl/).

Next, clone the repository

```bash
git clone github.com/gteditor99/lke
```

and run `go build` in the root directory of the repository.

This will create a binary called `lke` in the same directory.

## Usage

To use `lke`, simply drag and drop a `.ltx` file onto the `lke` executable. This will open the file in a new window.
